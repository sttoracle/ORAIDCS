# Oracle Identity Cloud Service

Oracle Identity Cloud Service (**IDCS**) provides an innovative, fully integrated service that delivers all the core identity and access management capabilities through a multi-tenant Cloud platform. 

When your organization subscribes to **Oracle Public Cloud**, you automatically get access to an **IDCS** environment, since all *Oracle Public Cloud* services automatically leverage *IDCS* as their core Identity and Access management provider.

This in turns opens up the possibility of further expanding your **IDCS** environment to secure and to provide **Identity and Access Management** services to your LOB's and even your entire organization in a fraction of the cost of other services that you would have to maintain separately.

On the other hand, if you are not using *Oracle Public Cloud*, *IDCS* stands on its own as the `next-generation Identity and Access management` system that can secure your enterprise at every level and can encompass both systems on cloud or on-premise (**Hybrid**). 

Detailed documentation on how to get started with Oracle Identity Cloud Service including getting started materials, tutorials, videos, blogs, and additional demonstrations are available [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/identity-cloud/index.html)

This demonstration focuses on the essential and useful features of IDCS for `User`, `Administrator` and `Developer` communities to help you understand the benefits of using our next generation Identity and Access management solution.
