#Oracle Identity Cloud Service

Oracle Identity Cloud Service (**IDCS**) provides an innovative, fully integrated service that delivers all the core identity and access management capabilities through a multi-tenant Cloud platform. 

When your organization subscribes to **Oracle Public Cloud**, you automatically get access to an **IDCS** environment, since all *Oracle Public Cloud* services automaticlly leverage *IDCS* as their core Identity and Access management provider.

This in turns opens up possibility of further expanding your **IDCS** environment to `secure` and provide `Identity and Access management` services to your LOB's and even your entire organization in a fraction of costs otherwise needed.

On the other hand, if you are not using *Oracle Public Cloud*, *IDCS* stands on its own as the `next-generation Identity and Access management` system that can secure your enterprise at every level and can ecompass both systems on cloud or on-premise (**Hybrid**).
