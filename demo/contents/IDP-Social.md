# Social Identity Provider

Oracle Identity Cloud Service(IDCS) supports social identity providers so that users can log in to IDCS with their social credentials. Social login feature allows users to self-register in IDCS if they do not already have an account.

## End-to-end Configuration

For configuring social authentication with Google, an OAuth client need to be setup in [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com). In the demo, existing OAuth client details (**Client ID** and **Client Secret**) have been used. 

The end-to-end integration starting from setup in [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com), has been captured in this *less than 7 minutes* video -
