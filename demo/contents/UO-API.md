# User On-boarding - API

The Oracle Identity Cloud Service REST APIs support SCIM 2.0 compliant endpoints with standard SCIM 2.0 core schemas and Oracle schema extensions to programmatically manage users, groups, applications, and identity functions, such as password management and administrative tasks. 

To make REST API calls to your Oracle Identity Cloud Service environment, you need an OAuth2 access token to use for authorization. The access token provides a session (with scope and expiration), that your client application can use to perform tasks in Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
