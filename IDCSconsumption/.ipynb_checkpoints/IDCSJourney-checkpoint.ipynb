    "# Oracle Identity Cloud Service\n",
    "There are many services on the Oracle Cloud yet they all have one item in common...A requirement to login!  Rather than forcing users to memorize a different name and password for each service, Oracle provides the Identity Cloud Service (IDCS).  IDCS enables one to centrally manage users so they only need to know one user name but can have multiple authentication methods depending on the risk / security requirements of the services you are depending on. IDCS is not just for Oracle Cloud, it may also be used for other cloud services and even on-premises applications.\n",

    "Our journey will start by gathering information about your environment so we can properly provision IDCS and configure it to meet your business requirements.  Our first task is to know who to email for administrative reasons.  Your end users will see this in emails and on screen so a help desk email maybe appropriate.  Likewise, getting reports according to local time zone may help in recognizing when actions occur.\n",

    "Knowing if your services are going to be used by consumers or enterprise users (Employees/contractors/partners) determines the billing rate per event = Active User per Hour [Universal Credit Pricing](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/ucpricing). To determine exact qualifying events please lookup the definition at the http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/contracts/paas-iaas-universal-credits-3940775.pdf (???had to search oracle to get this PDF to work???)\n",
    "Below is a simplified flow that can help you determine as well as questions that you may not have the answers to until you read lower in the document. The good news is you really only need to know if your services are for consumers or enterprise users as once provisioned the features used determine the actual billing, you don't have to upgrade/downgrade or anything else.\n",

    "When IDCS provides the only name and password a user ever needs, life will be much easier!  Until that time, your employees have many user names and passwords they have to remember so why add another name and password?\n",
    "You may not have a local Identity Provider to delegate authentication to (SAML IDP) so using a local password may make sense.  Users will have to remember that password which is why we offer password recovery for consumers and Basic tier of IDCS. Some services that can use IDCS don't allow federation today so a local IDCS Password may still be required (SSH and Kerberos???)\n",

    "### How will users/groups be created?\n",
    "While manually or batch jobs are fairly simple to do, the ability for data entry error exists as does the timeliness of entry.  Automated methods rely on an authoritative source that notifies changes to occur in IDCS.  \n",
    "For Employees there is normally a Human Capital Management program that has rigorous checks in place on when a user is valid, goes on leave or terminated. Most companies have already implemented an HCM to Identity Management or Active Directory automation.  This enables IDCS's Active Directory Bridge to provide a simple one step removed from the authoritative source identity synchronization to IDCS. The AD Bridge takes less than an hour to implement per AD domain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, IDCS would also be populated from HCM but on-premises Identity and Management programs can be a long process to implement.  Oracle Identity Manager (OIM) provides an IDCS connector to speed this process but expect 1-4 weeks to implement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When no authoritative source exists, self-registration or leveraging social login registration(see above) may meet your requirements for initial user creation.  You will still need to determine how best to remove/update these type of accounts if the users don't maintain their own.\n",
