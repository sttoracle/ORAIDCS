    "My Services is the \"dashboard\" to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - Traditional IaaS/PaaS services.  These services were available before IDCS and relied on a \"Shared Identity Manager (SIM)\" user, app role and custom app roles (grouping mechanism for permissions) repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIM User provisioning is manual or CSV import so in order to federate to SIM from IDCS, provisioning must first occur manually.  There was a Development IDCS App Template to create users in SIM from IDCS but due to the migration of SIM to IDCS for the majority of services,is not expected until Q1CY2018.  This app template may provision users to App Roles in Q2CY2018 if migration from SIM to IDCS for your PaaS/IaaS is not seamless.\n",
