    "Your access to cloud service instances is restricted by cloud service security, as controlled by Oracle Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) or WebLogic LDAP. If you’re an authorized user, you’re granted access according to your assigned role.\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity management option is defined in the Oracle Analytics Cloud service management interface. If IDCS is enabled, users are created in the IDCS administration interface. Users with a Service Administrator role in IDCS can directly log into Essbase, and are automatically provisioned with an Essbase Service Administrator role. IDCS users with a Service User role require further user provisioning on the cloud service, by a Service Administrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users must have an account in the identity domain associated with the cloud service. Users are created and assigned to predefined roles on the Security page in Oracle Analytics Cloud - Essbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to your assigned role, you can view and work with applications, cubes, and databases. Your role links you to the business activities that you’re permitted to perform within a cloud service instance, and the application data that you can access.\n"
