    "# Oracle Identity Cloud Service\n",
    "There are many services on the Oracle Cloud yet they all have one item in common...A requirement to login!  Rather than forcing users to memorize a different name and password for each service, Oracle provides the Identity Cloud Service.  IDCS enables one to centrally manage users so they only need to know one user name but can have multiple authentication methods depending on the risk / security requirements of the services you are depending on. IDCS is not just for Oracle Cloud, it may also be used for other cloud services and even on-premises applications.\n",
